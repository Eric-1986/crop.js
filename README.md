crop.js
=======

crop.js is an effort to build a dynamic (generic) crop and grassland growth model entirly in JavaScript.

## Genealogy
The (generic) crop and soil model is based on [MONICA](http://monica.agrosystem-models.com/). MONICA is based on [HERMES](http://www.zalf.de/en/forschung/institute/lsa/forschung/oekomod/hermes/Pages/default.aspx) and [DAISY](https://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/). HERMES is based on [SUCROS](http://models.pps.wur.nl/node/3). The grassland model is based on the [SGS Pasture Model](http://imj.com.au/sgs/), which implements various [Thornley&Johnson](http://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=Thornley+Johnson+grass) models and approaches.
